Why do pair mutators start with a leading 'm' in DrRacket?
===

In DrRacket, mutation related operations (mcons, mcar, mcdr, set-mcar, set-mcdr, etc) are named with a leading 'm', rather than keeping the same with ordinary operations (cons, car, cdr) that is used in SICP. Why?

An [explanation](http://blog.racket-lang.org/2007/11/getting-rid-of-set-car-and-set-cdr.html) has been written on there blog.
