How to test and play with the code
---
In [DrRacket.exe](https://racket-lang.org/), select File -> Open, locate these files, open one of them, then click "Run".

*Chapter.2.pict-lang.rkt* requires the package 'sicp' to run, which can be installed by following [these steps](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html).

Some notes:
---
I use \<func-name>-x.xx if 'func-name' is a built-in name of Racket.
