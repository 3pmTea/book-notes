How to test and play with the code
---
Open [DrRacket.exe](https://racket-lang.org/), and copy & paste all the code in one of these files into the definitions area, then click the "Run" button.

*Chapter.2.pict-lang.rkt* requires the package 'sicp' to run, which can be installed by following [these steps](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/index.html).

Some notes:
---
I use \<func-name>-x.xx if 'func-name' is a built-in name of Racket.
